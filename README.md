# Sporty Group Test (sporty-group-test)

Sporty Group assessment test

## Overview

The project uses Quasar Framework since it is what I am most recently familiar with and helps quickly complete the task at hand.

## AI tools

I am using Github Copilot on my VSCode. So I do get some auto-suggestions here and there, mostly complimenting my code. I didn't need to use it for scaffolding since Quasar has a CLI that lets me start a new project.

## Architecture

### API layer

A type-safe way to define the API contract. Ideally this could be auto-generated by tools that consume the OpenAPI YAML specification of the API and generate a TypeScript API client to be used by the app.

### Caching

Caching is enabled with the help of TanStack Query lib. This means that any queries or mutations from/to the server API needs to go through the TanStack lib in order for caching and cache invalidation to work seamlessly. Caching is in memory, not persisted for this demo.
