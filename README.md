# Sporty Group Test (sporty-group-test)

Sporty Group assessment test

## Overview

The project uses Quasar Framework since it is what I am most recently familiar with and helps quickly complete the task at hand.

### Architecture

#### API layer

A type-safe way to define the API contract. Ideally this could be auto-generated by tools that consume the OpenAPI YAML specification of the API and generate a TypeScript API client to be used by the app.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```

### Format the files

```bash
yarn format
# or
npm run format
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
